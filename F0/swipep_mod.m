% SWIPEP Pitch estimation using SWIPE'.
%    P = SWIPEP(X,Fs,[PMIN PMAX],DT,DLOG2P,DERBS,STHR) estimates the pitch 
%    of the vector signal X every DT seconds. The sampling frequency of
%    the signal is Fs (in Hertz). The spectrum is computed using a Hann
%    window with an overlap WOVERLAP between 0 and 1. The spectrum is
%    sampled uniformly in the ERB scale with a step size of DERBS ERBs. The
%    pitch is searched within the range [PMIN PMAX] (in Hertz) with samples
%    distributed every DLOG2P units on a base-2 logarithmic scale of Hertz. 
%    The pitch is fine-tuned using parabolic interpolation with a resolution
%    of 1 cent. Pitch estimates with a strength lower than STHR are treated
%    as undefined.
%    
%    [P,T,S] = SWIPEP(X,Fs,[PMIN PMAX],DT,DLOG2P,DERBS,WOVERLAP,STHR) 
%    returns the times T at which the pitch was estimated and the pitch 
%    strength S of every pitch estimate.
%
%    P = SWIPEP(X,Fs) estimates the pitch using the default settings PMIN =
%    30 Hz, PMAX = 5000 Hz, DT = 0.001 s, DLOG2P = 1/48 (48 steps per 
%    octave), DERBS = 0.1 ERBs, WOVERLAP = 0.5, and STHR = -Inf.
%
%    P = SWIPEP(X,Fs,...,[],...) uses the default setting for the parameter
%    replaced with the placeholder [].
%
%    REMARKS: (1) For better results, make DLOG2P and DERBS as small as 
%    possible and WOVERLAP as large as possible. However, take into account
%    that the computational complexity of the algorithm is inversely 
%    proportional to DLOG2P, DERBS and 1-WOVERLAP, and that the  default 
%    values have been found empirically to produce good results. Consider 
%    also that the computational complexity is directly proportional to the
%    number of octaves in the pitch search range, and therefore , it is 
%    recommendable to restrict the search range to the expected range of
%    pitch, if any. (2) This code implements SWIPE', which uses only the
%    first and prime harmonics of the signal. To convert it into SWIPE,
%    which uses all the harmonics of the signal, replace the word
%    PRIMES with a colon (it is located almost at the end of the code).
%    However, this may not be recommendable since SWIPE' is reported to 
%    produce on average better results than SWIPE (Camacho and Harris,
%    2008).
%
%    EXAMPLE: Estimate the pitch of the signal X every 10 ms within the
%    range 75-500 Hz using the default resolution (i.e., 48 steps per
%    octave), sampling the spectrum every 1/20th of ERB, using a window 
%    overlap factor of 50%, and discarding samples with pitch strength 
%    lower than 0.2. Plot the pitch trace.
%       [x,Fs] = wavread(filename);
%       [p,t,s] = swipep(x,Fs,[75 500],0.01,[],1/20,0.5,0.2);
%       plot(1000*t,p)
%       xlabel('Time (ms)')
%       ylabel('Pitch (Hz)')
