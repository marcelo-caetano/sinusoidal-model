function [time_frame,center_frame,nsample,nframe,nchannel,dc] = sof(wav,framelen,hop,winflag,causalflag,normflag)
%SOF Split into overlapping frames.
%   FR = SOF(S,M,H,WINFLAG,CAUSALFLAG,NORMFLAG) splits the input S into
%   overlapping frames FR of length M with a hop size H.
%
%   WINFLAG is a numeric flag that specifies the following windows
%
%   1 - Rectangular
%   2 - Bartlett
%   3 - Hann
%   4 - Hanning
%   5 - Blackman
%   6 - Blackman-Harris
%   7 - Hamming
%
%   CAUSALFLAG is a character flag that determines the causality of the
%   window. CAUSALFLAG can be 'ANTI', 'NON', or 'CAUSAL' for anti-causal,
%   non-causal, or causal respectively. The sample CENTERWIN corresponding
%   to the center of the first window is obtained as
%   CENTERWIN = tools.dsp.centerwin(M,CAUSALFLAG).
%
%   NORMFLAG is a boolean that specifies if the window is normalized as
%   normw(n)=w(n)/sum(w(n)). NORMFLAG = TRUE normalizes and FALSE does not.
%
%   [FR,CFR,NSAMPLE,NFRAME,NCHANNEL,DC] = SOF(...) also returns the vector
%   CFR with the samples corresponding to the center of the time frames FR,
%   the original number of time samples NSAMPLE of S, the number of frames
%   NFRAME, the number of channels NCHANNEL, AND the dc value DC of S.
