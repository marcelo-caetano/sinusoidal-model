function ph = phasedft(bin,nfft,shift)
%PHASEDFT Phase of the discrete Fourier transform.
%   P = PHASEDFT(K,NFFT,SHIFT) returns the complex phase P of the discrete
%   Fourier transform as P = exp(-1j*(F*SHIFT)), where F is the normalized 
%   frequency and SHIFT is the corresponding time domain shift. The
%   normalized frequency is F = 2*pi*K/NFFT, where K is the vector of
%   frequency bins and NFFT is the size of the DFT.
