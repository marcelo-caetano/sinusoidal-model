function offset = causal_offset(framelen,causalflag)
%CAUSAL_OFFSET Frame offset for causal processing.
%   OFFSET = CAUSAL_OFFSET(M,CAUSALFLAG) returns the corresponding
%   causal offset OFFSET for a given frame length M according to the text
%   flag CAUSALFLAG. OFFSET changes the initial position of the first
%   processing frame, which always starts at the first time sample. Thus
%   CAUSALFLAG determines the causality of the processing by positioning 
%   the first frame according to the three following cases:
%
%   CAUSALFLAG = CAUSAL positions the first window totally inside the
%   signal, so OFFSET = 0 for causal processing. Useful for sinusoidal
%   modeling of sustained sounds.
%
%   CAUSALFLAG = NON positions the center of the first window at the first
%   time sample, so OFFSET = -LEFTWIN for non-causal processing. Useful for
%   sinusoidal modeling of percussive sounds.
%
%   CAUSALFLAG = ANTI positions the first window totally outside the
%   signal, so OFFSET = -M for anti-causal processing commonly used for OLA
%   resynthesis.
