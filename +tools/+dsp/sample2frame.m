function frame = sample2frame(sample,center_win,hop)
%SAMPLE2FRAME Convert time sample to time frame number.
%   FR = SAMPLE2FRAME(S,CENTERWIN,H) returns the time frame numbers FR
%   corresponding to the center of an M-sample long window sliding by a
%   hopsize of H samples. The sample S(1) corresponding to the center of
%   the first window is CENTERWIN = CENTER_FIRST_WIN(M,CAUSALFLAG),
%   CAUSALFLAG is a text flag that specifies the causality of the first
%   window as 'NON', 'CAUSAL', or 'ANTI'.
