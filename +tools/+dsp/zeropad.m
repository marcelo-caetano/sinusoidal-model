function zpadframe = zeropad(frame,nfft)
%ZPAD Zero padding.
%   ZP = ZPAD(FR,NFFT) zero pads the columns of the time frames FR up to
%   NFFT. FR is size M x NFRAME x NCHANNEL, where M is the frame length,
%   NFRAME is the number of frames, and NCHANNEL is the number of channels.
%
%   If NFFT > M, ZP is size NFFT x NFRAME x NCHANNEL with zeros from M+1 to
%   NFFT.
%
%   If NFFT <= M, ZP == FR.
