function sample = frame2sample(frame,framelen,hop,causalflag)
%FRAME2SAMPLE Convert frame number to time sample.
%   S = FRAME2SAMPLE(FR,M,H,CAUSALFLAG) returns the time samples S
%   corresponding to the center of the frames FR obtained with an M-sample
%   long window sliding by a hopsize of H samples. The text flag CAUSALFLAG
%   specifies the causality of the first window as 'NON', 'CAUSAL', or 'ANTI'.
