function delta = freq_diff4peak_matching(fundfreq,mult)
%FREQ_DIFF4PEAK_MATCHING Frequency difference for peak matching.
%   DELTA = FREQ_DIFF4PEAK_MATCHING(F0) returns the frequency difference
%   for peak matching DELTA used internally in PEAK2PEAK_FREQ_MATCHING as
%   DELTA = 0.5*F0. For harmonic sounds, DELTA is set as half the distance
%   between the harmonics.
%
%   DELTA = FREQ_DIFF4PEAK_MATCHING(F0,MULT) uses MULT as the multiplier.
%   Typically, 0 < MULT <= 0.5.
