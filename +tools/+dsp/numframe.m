function nframe = numframe(nsample,framelen,hop,causalflag)
%NFRAMES Number of frames.
%   F = NUMFRAME(NSAMPLE,M,H,CAUSALFLAG) returns the number of frames F
%   that a NSAMPLE-long signal will have when split into overlapping frames
%   of length M by a hop H and first window centered at CAUSALFLAG. The
%   text flag CAUSALFLAG specifies the sample corresponding to the center
%   of the first analysis window. CAUSALFLAG can be CAUSAL, NON, or ANTI.
