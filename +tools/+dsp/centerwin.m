function csample = centerwin(framelen,causalflag)
%CENTERWIN Center of the first window in signal reference (samples).
%   C = CENTERWIN(FRAMELEN,CAUSALFLAG) returns the sample C at the center
%   of the first analysis window with FRAMELEN samples. CAUSALFLAG is a
%   character flag that determines the causality of the window. CAUSALFLAG
%   can be 'ANTI', 'NON', or 'CAUSAL' for anti-causal, non-causal, or
%   causal respectively. The default is CAUSALFLAG = 'NON'.
