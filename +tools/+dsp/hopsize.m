function hop = hopsize(framelen,overlap)
%HOPSIZE Hop size corresponding to overlap.
%   H = HOPSIZE(FRAMELEN) returns the hop size H corresponding to 50%
%   overlap of consecutive frames.
%
%   H = HOPSIZE(FRAMELEN,OVERLAP) returns H corresponding to consecutive
%   frames overlapping by 0 <= OVERLAP < 1. OVERLAP = 0 means no overlap,
%   so the frames will be adjacent with H = FRAMELEN. Note that OVERLAP = 1
%   is not allowed because it implies H = 0.
