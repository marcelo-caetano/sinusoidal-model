function bool = istrough(mag)
% ISTROUGH True for troughs.
%   BOOL = ISTROUGH(MAG) returns a logical vector BOOL with the positions of
%   the troughs of MAG. BOOL is the same size as MAG and contains TRUE for
%   positions that correspond to troughs and FALSE otherwise. A trough is
%   defined as being either a 3-point trough or a 2-point trough. Type HELP
%   TOOLS.PSEL.IS3PTTROUGH, HELP TOOLS.PSEL.IS2PTTROUGHR, and
%   HELP TOOLS.PSEL.IS2PTTROUGHL for further information.
