function bool_trough = is3pttrough(mag)
% IS3PTTROUGH True for spectral troughs of the magnitude spectrum.
%   BOOL = IS3PTTROUGH(MAG) returns a logical vector BOOL with the
%   positions of the spectral troughs of MAG. BOOL is the same size as MAG
%   and contains TRUE for positions that correspond to spectral troughs
%   and FALSE otherwise. A spectral peak is defined as a spectral
%   magnitude MAG that is greater than both its immediate neighbors.
