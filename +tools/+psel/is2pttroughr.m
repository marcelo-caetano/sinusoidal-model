function bool_trough = is2pttroughr(mag)
% IS2PTTROUGHR True for right symmetrical troughs of the magnitude spectrum.
%   BOOL = IS2PTTROUGHR(MAG) returns a logical vector BOOL with the
%   positions of the right symmetrical troughs of MAG. BOOL is the same size
%   as MAG and contains TRUE for positions that correspond to right symmetrical
%   troughs and FALSE otherwise. A right symmetrical trough is defined as a
%   spectral magnitude MAG that is lower than its immediate neighbor to the
%   left and equal to its immediate neighbor to the right.
