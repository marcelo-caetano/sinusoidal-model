function ref0 = reference_f0(f0,f0flag)
%REFERENCE_F0 Reference value for the fundamental frequency.
%   REF0 = REFERENCE_F0(F0) returns the median value REF0 of the
%   fundamental frequency estimations F0. REF0 is a scalar and F0 can be a
%   vector or multidimensional array.
%
%   REF0 = REFERENCE_F0(F0,FOFLAG) uses the logical flag F0FLAG to specify
%   if REF0 is the median or the mean of F0. F0FLAG = FALSE uses the median
%   and F0FLAG = TRUE uses the mean. The default is F0FLAG = FALSE when
%   REFERENCE_F0 is called with one input argument.
