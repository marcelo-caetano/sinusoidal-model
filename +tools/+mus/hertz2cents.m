function  cents = hertz2cents(freq_num,freq_den)
%HERTZ2CENTS Interval in cents between two frequencies in Hz.
%   C = HERTZ2CENTS(F,REF) returns the interval C in cents corresponding to
%   the frequencies F and REF in Hz. REF is the reference frequency, such
%   that the conversion is C = 1200*log2(F/REF).
