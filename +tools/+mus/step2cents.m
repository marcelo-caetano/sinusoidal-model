function cents = step2cents(step)
%STEP2CENTS Interval in cents corresponding to number of steps.
%   C = STEP2CENTS(S) returns the frequency interval C expressed in cents
%   corresponding to the integer number of steps S as C = 100*S. S must be
%   an integer number of steps otherwise the values will be rounded.
