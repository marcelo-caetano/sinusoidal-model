function step = note2step(note)
%NOTE2STEP Convert from note to number of steps.
%   S = NOTE2STEP(NOTE) converts the NOTE in the German system to the
%   corresponding number of steps in the equal tempered scale.
%
%   NOTE must be a character array in the following format: LETTER(OPT)NUMBER
%   LETTER specifies the pitch class between A and G
%   OPT specifies that the pitch class is sharp (omit otherwise)
%   NUMBER specifies the octave between 0 and 8
%
%   Examples: A#3, G7, D0, F#6
