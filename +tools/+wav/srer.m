function rms_db = srer(sig,res,logflag,nanflag)
%SRER Calculate the signal-to-resynthesis energy ratio.
%   E = SRER(S,R) returns the signal-to-resynthesis energy ratio E in dB
%   power between the signal S and the residual R. The SRER is defined as
%   E = 20*log10[RMS(S)/RMS(R)] dB. The residual R is obtained as
%   R = S - \hat(S), where \hat(S) is S resynthesized after a modeling
%   step. SRER works with mono, stereo, or multi-channel signals assuming
%   that each channel is a column of S.
%
%   E = SRER(S,R,LOGFLAG) uses LOGFLAG to determine the logarithmic scale
%   used in E. LOGFLAG can be 'DBR' for decibel root-power, 'DBP' for
%   decibel power, 'BEL' for bels, 'NEP' for neper, and 'OCT' for octave.
%   See HELP LIN2LOG for further details.
