function mono = stereo2mono(stereo)
%STEREO2MONO Dowmix stereo audio to mono.
%   M = STEREO2MONO(S) downmixes stereo audio in S into mono audio in M.
%
%   S has one channel per column as returned by audioread. So S is NSAMPLE
%   by NCHANNEL, where NSAMPLE is the total number of samples of the audio
%   file and NCHANNEL is the number of channels.
%
%   M = S when N = 1. M = 0.5*S(:,1)+0.5*S(:,2) when NCHANNEL = 2. Finally,
%   STEREO2MONO returns an error whenever NCHANNEL > 2.
