function [olasynth,olawin] = ola(time_frame,framelen,winflag,nsample,center_frame,nframe,nchannel,causalflag,dispflag)
%OLA Overlap-Add time frames to resynthesize waveform.
%   SYNTH = OLA(FR,M,WINFLAG,NSAMPLE,CFR,NFRAME,NCHANNEL,CAUSALFLAG) overlap-adds
%   the time frames FR by M - H, where M is the frame length and H is the
%   hop size used to make the time frames and returns SYNTH.
%
%   NSAMPLE is the length of the original signal in samples. NSAMPLE is
%   usually different than CENTERWIN+(NFRAME-1)*H because the last frame is
%   always zero-padded to M. Therefore, SYNTH must be truncated to NSAMPLE
%   to recover the original signal length.
%
%   CFR is an array with the samples corresponding to the center of the
%   frames.
%
%   NFRAME is the number of time frames FR. FR is size NSAMPLE x NFRAME.
%
%   WINFLAG is a numeric flag that specifies the following windows
%
%   1 - Rectangular
%   2 - Bartlett
%   3 - Hann
%   4 - Hanning
%   5 - Blackman
%   6 - Blackman-Harris
%   7 - Hamming
%
%   CAUSALFLAG is a character flag that determines the causality of the
%   window. CAUSALFLAG can be 'ANTI', 'NON', or 'CAUSAL' for anti-causal,
%   non-causal, or causal respectively. The sample CENTERWIN corresponding
%   to the center of the first window is obtained as
%   CENTERWIN = tools.dsp.centerwin(M,CAUSALFLAG). Type help
%   tools.dsp.centerwin for further details.
%
%   [SYNTH,OLAWIN] = OLA(...) also returns the overlap-added window OLAWIN
%   specified by WINFLAG.
