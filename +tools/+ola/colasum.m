function sumfactor = colasum(winflag)
%COLASUM COLA constant for different windows.
%   SUM = tools.ola.colasum(WINTYPE) returns SUM for a window of type WINTYPE.
%
%   SUM = COLA(R) for hop size R = M/DEN, expressed as a fraction of the
%   window size M. DEN depends on WINTYPE. Type WHICHWIN(WINTYPE) for the
%   names of the different windows supported.
