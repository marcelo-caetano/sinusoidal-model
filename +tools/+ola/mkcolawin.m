function win = mkcolawin(framelen,winflag)
%MKCOLAWIN Make COLA window.
%   W = MKCOLAWIN(M,WINFLAG) makes a window W that is M samples
%   long and that has the constant overlap-add (COLA) property. The flag
%   WINFLAG controls the window type. The possibilities for WINFLAG are:
%
%   1 - Rectangular
%   2 - Bartlett
%   3 - Hann
%   4 - Hanning
%   5 - Blackman
%   6 - Blackman-Harris
%   7 - Hamming
%   8 - Bartlett-Hann
%   9 - Gaussian
%   10 - Slepian
%   11 - Kaiser-Bessel
%   12 - Nuttall
%   13 - Dolph-Chebychev
%   14 - Tukey
%
%   The window W is carefully designed to be COLA and to ensure that the
%   center of W is an integer sample number. Consequently, even M
%   results in periodic windows, whereas odd M results in symmetric
%   windows. See the help for each window given by WINFLAG for further
%   information.
