function phspec = fft2phase_spec(fft_frame)
%FFT2PHASE_SPEC From FFT to phase spectrum.
%   P = FFT2PHASE_SPEC(FFTFR) returns the phase spectrum P of the complex
%   FFTFR array containing STFT data of size NFFT x NFRAME x NCHANNEL,
%   where NFFT is the size of the FFT, NFRAME is the number of frames,
%   NCHANNEL is the number of audio channels.
