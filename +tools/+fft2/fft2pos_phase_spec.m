function posphspec = fft2pos_phase_spec(fft_frame,nfft)
%FFT2POS_PHASE_SPEC From FFT to positive phase spectrum.
%   PPS = FFT2POS_PHASE_SPEC(FFT) returns the phase spectrum of
%   the positive half of the complex FFT vector or matrix. FFT can be
%   either an NFFT x 1 colum vector or an NFFT x NFRAME matrix with NFRAME
%   frames of the STFT. PPS is INYQ x NFRAME, where INYQ is the number of
%   _non-negative_ frequency bins of the FFT obtained with POS_FREQ_BAND.
%   Type HELP TOOLS.SPEC.POS_FREQ_BAND for further information.
%
%   PPS = FFT2POS_PHASE_SPEC(FFT,NFFT) uses NFFT for the size of
%   the FFT.
