function t = mktime(varargin)
%MKTIME Make time vector in seconds.
%   T = MKTIME(L,SR) makes a time vector T in seconds corresponding to the
%   length L in samples using the sample rate SR as T = (0:L-1)/SR.
%
%   T = MKTIME(S,E,SR) makes a time vector in seconds between the start
%   sample S and the end sample E using the sample rate SR as
%   T = (S-1:E-1)/SR.
