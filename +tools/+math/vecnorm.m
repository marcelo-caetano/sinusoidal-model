function vnorm = vecnorm(v,dim)
%VECNORM Vector norm.
%   VNORM = VECNORM(V) returns the norm of the multidimensional array V
%   calculated as VNORM = sqrt(sum(V.^2)). V is assumed to be column
%   vectors of size NROW x NCOL x NPAGE, so VNORM is calculated along the
%   columns of V and is size 1 x NCOL x NPAGE.
%
%   VNORM = VECNORM(V,DIM) returns the norm of the multidimensional array V
%   alond dimension DIM calculated as VNORM = sqrt(sum(v.^2,DIM)). DIM must
%   be an integer scalar.
