function [xm,ym,conc] = quadfit(x1,x2,x3,y1,y2,y3,tol)
%THREEPT_QUADFIT Three-point quadratic fit.
%   [Xm,Ym] = THREEPT_QUADFIT(X1,X2,X3,Y1,Y2,Y3) returns the points (Xm,Ym)
%   corresponding to the vertex of the parabola fit to the pairs of points
%   (X1 X2 X3) and (Y1 Y2 Y3).
%
%   For a parabola given by the general equation Y-Ym = CONC(X-Xm)^2, Xm is
%   the abscissae of the vertex, Ym is the ordinates of the vertex, and
%   CONC is the concavity of the parabola.
%
%   Given X1, X2, and X3 with their corresponding Y1, Y2, and Y3, the
%   parameters of the parabola Xm, Ym, and CONC cab be obtained
%   respectively as:
%
%   Xm = ((Y2-Y1)(X3-X1)(X3+X1)+(Y1-Y3)(X2-X1)(X2+X1))/(2*(Y1-Y2)(X1-X3)+(Y3-Y1)(X1-X2)).
%
%   CONC = (Y2-Y1)/((X2-X1)(X1+X2-2*Xm)).
%
%   Ym = Y1-CONC*(X1-Xm)^2.
%
%   [Xm,Ym] = THREEPT_QUADFIT(X1,X2,X3,Y1,Y2,Y3,TOL) uses the tolerance TOL
%   to avoid division by zero when X1 and X3 are symmetrical around Xm. The
%   values of Y1 and Y3 are used as ABS(Y1-Y3) < TOL.
%
%   [Xm,Ym,CONC] = QUADFIT(...) also returns the concavities CONC.
