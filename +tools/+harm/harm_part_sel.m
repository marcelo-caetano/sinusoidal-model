%   [H,P,MAXNHARM] = HARM_PART_SEL(D,F,MAX_HARM_NUM,NPART,NFRAME,NCHANNEL,
%   MAX_HARM_DEV,HARM_THRESH,HARMPARTFLAG) returns the _active harmonics_ H
%   and the partial tracks that are harmonic P. Both H and P are arrays of
%   logicals. The _active harmonics_ are the harmonic numbers that have
%   partial tracks within HARM_THRESH of the harmonic template. D is the
%   distance between the harmonic template and the partial tracks, F is the
%   frequencies of the partials, MAX_HARM_NUM is the highest harmonic
%   number in F, NPART is the number of partials, NFRAME is the number of
%   frames, and NCHANNEL is the number of channels.
%
%   [H,P,MAXNHARM] = HARM_PART_SEL(D,F,MAX_HARM_NUM,NPART,NFRAME,NCHANNEL,
%   MAX_HARM_DEV) uses MAX_HARM_DEV as the maximum harmonic deviation in
%   cents to consider a frequency peak as harmonic. The default is
%   MAX_HARM_DEV = 100.
%
%   [H,P,MAXNHARM] = HARM_PART_SEL(D,F,MAX_HARM_NUM,NPART,NFRAME,NCHANNEL,
%   MAX_HARM_DEV,HARM_THRESH) uses HARM_THRESH as the normalized harmonic
%   threshold. HARM_THRESH = 0 will select all partials regardless of 
%   MAX_HARM_DEV. HARM_THRESH = 1 will only select partials that have 100% 
%   of the frequency peaks within MAX_HARM_DEV. Ideally, HARM_THRESH should
%   allow for a small percentage of the frequency values to be outside of
%   MAX_HARM_DEV. The default is HARM_THRESH = 0.8.
%
%   [H,P,MAXNHARM] = HARM_PART_SEL(D,F,MAX_HARM_NUM,NPART,NFRAME,NCHANNEL,
%   MAX_HARM_DEV,HARM_THRESH,HARMPARTFLAG) uses HARMPARTFLAG to select the
%   algorithm to resolve conflicts in harmonic selection. HARMPARTFLAG =
%   'COUNT' selects the partials with the highest relative number of
%   harmonic peaks across all frames and HARMPARTFLAG = 'MEAN' selects the 
%   partials with the smallest average harmonic distance across all frames.

% ALGORITHMIC STEPS
%
% Each partial track may have active (F) and inactive (NaN) peaks
%
% Spectral peaks are compared to a harmonic grid
%
% Spectral peaks whose harmonic deviation from the grid is smaller than
% MAX_HARM_DEV are considered to be harmonic
%
% Each partial track is given a _harmonic score_ calculated as follows
% HARM_SCORE = NHARM_PEAK/NACTIVE_PEAK
%
% Partial tracks whose HARM_SCORE >= HARM_THRESH are considered to be
% _harmonic_
%
% Potential conflicts (more than one partial track assigned to the same
% harmonic) are resolved
%
% Harmonic partial tracks are assigned to the corresponding harmonic
