function bin = interp_bin(nfft,framelen)
%INTERP_BIN Interpolation of frequency bins
%   B = INTERP_BIN(NFFT,FRAMELEN) returns the number of frequency bins B
%   corresponding to a spectral interpolation of NFFT/FRAMELEN, where NFFT
%   is the size of the FFT and FRAMELEN is the window size. The spectral
%   interpolation operation corresponds to zero-padding in the time domain
%   by NFFT - FRAMELEN.
