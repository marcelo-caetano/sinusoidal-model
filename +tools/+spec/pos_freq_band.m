function nbin = pos_freq_band(nfft)
%POS_FREQ_BAND Positive frequency band.
%   PB = POS_FREQ_BAND(NFFT) returns the length of the positive frequency
%   band in bins of a spectrum obtained with an FFT of size NFFT.
%   PB includes the zero-frequency and Nyquist-frequency bins for even NFFT
%   but only the zero-frequency bin for odd NFFT since the Nyquist bin is
%   fractional in that case.
