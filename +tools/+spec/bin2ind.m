function ind = bin2ind(bin,nfft)
%BIN2IND Convert frequency bin number into array index.
%   IND = BIN2IND(K) converts the frequency bins K into the corresponding
%   array index IND. Fractional bin numbers are rounded off to the nearest
%   integer. K can be a scalar, array, or matrix. This syntax is equivalent
%   to IND = K + 1, so only non-negative bin numbers are allowed.
%
%   IND = BIN2IND(K,NFFT) is the syntax for when there are negative bin
%   numbers corresponding to the negative half of the sectrum. Negative
%   frequency bins are shifted by NFFT/2 - 1 to always result in positive
%   indices. Use MKFREQ with FREQLIMFLAG = 'NEGPOS' to generate negative
%   bin numbers or negative frequencies in Hertz.
