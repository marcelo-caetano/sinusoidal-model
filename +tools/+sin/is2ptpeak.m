function boolpeak = is2ptpeak(mag)
% IS2PTPEAK True for symmetrical peaks of the magnitude spectrum.
%   BOOL = IS2PTPEAK(MAG) returns a logical vector BOOL with the
%   positions of the symmetrical peaks of MAG. BOOL is the same size as MAG
%   and contains TRUE for positions that correspond to symmetrical peaks
%   and FALSE otherwise. A symmetrical peak is defined as a spectral
%   magnitude MAG that is equal to its immediate neighbor to the left and
%   greater than its immediate neighbor to the right.
