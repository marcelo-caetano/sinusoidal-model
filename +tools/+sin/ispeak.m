function bool = ispeak(mag)
% ISPEAK True for peaks.
%   BOOL = ISPEAK(MAG) returns a logical vector BOOL with the positions of
%   the peaks of MAG. BOOL is the same size as MAG and contains TRUE for
%   positions that correspond to peaks and FALSE otherwise. A peak is
%   defined as being either a 3-point peak or a 2-point peak. Type HELP
%   TOOLS.SPEC.IS3PTPEAK and HELP TOOLS.SPEC.IS2PTPEAK for further
%   information.
