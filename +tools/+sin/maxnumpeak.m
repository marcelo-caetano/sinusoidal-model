function [amp,freq,ph,sort_trunc_linear_index] = maxnumpeak(peak_amp,peak_freq,peak_ph,maxnpeak,nbin,nframe,nchannel,npeakflag)
%MAXNUMPEAK Maximum number of peaks.
%   [A,F,P] = MAXNUMPEAK(Ap,Fp,Pp,MAXNPEAK,NBIN,NFRAME,NCHANNEL) selects up
%   TO MAXNPEAK peaks per frame with the highest amplitude. Ap are the
%   amplitudes of the spectral peaks returned by PEAK_PICKING, Fp are the
%   frequencies of the spectral peaks, and Pp are the phases. Ap, Fp, and
%   Pp are NBIN x NFRAME X NCHANNEL multi-dimensional arrays, where NBIN is
%   the number of positive frequency bins, NFRAME is the number of frames,
%   and NCHANNEL is the number of channels. A, F, and P are arrays of size
%   NBIN x NFRAME x NCHANNEL with at most MAXNPEAK original peak values per
%   column and NaN filling the remaining bins.
%
%   [A,F,P] = MAXNUMPEAK(Ap,Fp,Pp,MAXNPEAK,NBIN,NFRAME,NCHANNEL,NPEAKFLAG)
%   uses the logical flag NPEAKFLAG to specify whether the output should
%   have MAXNPEAK rows instead of NBIN. NPEAKFLAG = TRUE sets A, F, and P
%   to have size MAXNPEAK x NFRAME x NCHANNEL and NPEAKFLAG = FALSE leaves
%   the size of the input untouched. The default is NPEAKFLAG = FALSE when
%   MAXNUMPEAK is called with the syntax above. Note that A, F, and P might
%   still have NaN across columns that had fewer peaks than MAXNPEAK.
