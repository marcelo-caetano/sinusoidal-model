function res = isfrac(num)
%ISINT True when the input is integer.
%   RES = ISINT(NUM) tests if the numeric value of NUM is integer and
%   returns logic TRUE or FALSE in RES. NUM can be a scalar, an array, or a
%   matrix.
%
%   Note: ISINT tests for the numeric value of NUM, not the class. Use
%   ISINTEGER(NUM) or CLASS(NUM) for the class of NUM. ISINT(NUM) returns
%   TRUE as long as the following conditions are both TRUE: ISNUMERIC(NUM)
%   && REM(NUM,1) == 0.
