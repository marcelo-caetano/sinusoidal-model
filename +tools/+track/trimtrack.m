%TRIMTRACK Trim partial track segments according to duration.
%   [A,F,P] = TRIMTRACK(A,F,P,H,Fs,NPART,NFRAME,NCHANNEL,DURTHRES,GAPTHRES,TIMESCALEFLAG)
%   only keeps the segments of partial tracks that are loger than DURTHRES
%   or that are preceded and followed by a gap shorter than GAPTHRES. A, F,
%   and P are respectively the amplitudes, frequencies, and phases of the
%   partial track segments. H is the hop size, Fs is the sampling frequency,
%   NPART is the number of partials, NFRAME is the number of frames, and
%   NCHANNEL is the number of audio channels. DURTHRESH is the minimum
%   duration threshold for partials in ms and GAPTHRES is the maximum
%   duration of gaps before and after the segments of partials to connect
%   over. DURGAP allows to keep partial track segments that are shorter
%   than DURTHRES as long as the gaps _before and after_ are shorter than
%   GAPTHRES.
