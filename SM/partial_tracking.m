function [amp,freq,ph,npart] = partial_tracking(amplitude,frequency,phase,delta,hop,fs,nframe,trackflag)
%PARTIAL_TRACKING Partial tracking for spectral modeling sinusoidal analysis.
%   [A,F,P,NPART] = PARTIAL_TRACKING(AMP,FREQ,PH,DELTA,H,Fs,NFR,TRACKFLAG)
%   performs partial tracking on the spectral peaks contained in AMP, FREQ,
%   and PH. DELTA determines the maximum frequency difference for peak
%   continuation as described in [1]. H is the analysis hop size, Fs is the
%   sampling frequency, and NFR is the total number of frames as returned
%   by the function NUMFRAME. Type HELP NUMFRAME for further information.
%
%   TRACKFLAG determines the partial tracking algorithm used. The options are
%
%   P2P peak-to-peak frequency tracking adapted from [1].
