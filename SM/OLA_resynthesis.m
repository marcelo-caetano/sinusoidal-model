function [addsynth,partial] = OLA_resynthesis(amplitude,phase,synthwin)
%OLA_RESYNTHESIS Resynthesis for the OLA method.
%   [SIN,PART] = PI_RESYNTHESIS(A,P,SWIN) resynthesizes the sinusoidal
%   component SIN and its isolated partials PART from the time-varying
%   amplitudes A and phases P. Each frame is amplitude modulated by the
%   synthesis window SWIN.
