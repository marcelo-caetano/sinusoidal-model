%PARTIAL_TRACK_DURATION Partial track selection using duration.
%   [Ad,Fd,Pd] = PARTIAL_TRACK_DURATION(A,F,P,H,Fs,NPART,NFRAME,NCHANNEL,DURTHRES,GAPTHRES)
%   trims segments of partial tracks whose duration is shorter than
%   DURTHRES ms and that have gaps (before and after) that are longer than
%   GAPTHRES ms. A, F, and P are respectively the amplitudes, frequencies,
%   and phases of the sinusoids _after partial tracking_, H is the hop size
%   in samples, and Fs is the sampling frequency in samples/s. NFRAME is
%   the number of frames and NCHANNEL is the number of channels.
