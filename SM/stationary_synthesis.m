%   THETA is the phase shift calculated as THETA = P - 2*pi*f*M/Fs, where M
%   is the frame length and Fs is the sampling rate.

% Make samples spanning frame framelen
samples = (cframe-tools.dsp.leftwin(framelen):cframe+tools.dsp.rightwin(framelen))';

% Make synthesis window
synthwin = tools.ola.mkcolawin(framelen,winflag);

% Calculate phase shift (using center of frame as reference)
phase_shift = ph - (2*pi*cframe/fs)*freq;

% Calculate phase argument
phase_argument = 2*pi*samples/fs*freq' + repmat(phase_shift',framelen,1);

% Constant amplitude across frame
amplitude = repmat(amp',framelen,1);

% Get frequencies as derivative of phases
frequency = gradient(phase_argument);
