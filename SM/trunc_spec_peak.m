function [amp,freq,ph,indmaxnpeak] = trunc_spec_peak(peak_amp,peak_freq,peak_ph,maxnpeak,nfft,nframe,nchannel,npeakflag)
%TRUNC_SPEC_PEAK Maximum number of peaks.
%   [A,F,P] = TRUNC_SPEC_PEAK(Ap,Fp,Pp,MAXNPEAK,NFFT,NFRAME,NCHANNEL)
%   selects up to MAXNPEAK peaks per frame with the highest amplitude Ap.
%   Fp and Pp are the corresponding frequencies and phases of the spectral
%   peaks. Ap, Fp, and Pp are NBIN x NFRAME X NCHANNEL multi-dimensional
%   arrays, where NBIN is the number of positive frequency bins, NFRAME is
%   the number of frames, and NCHANNEL is the number of channels. A, F, and
%   P are arrays of size NBIN x NFRAME x NCHANNEL with at most MAXNPEAK
%   original peak values per column and NaN filling the remaining bins.
%
%   [A,F,P] = TRUNC_SPEC_PEAK(Ap,Fp,Pp,MAXNPEAK,NFFT,NFRAME,NCHANNEL,NPEAKFLAG)
%   uses the logical flag NPEAKFLAG to specify whether the output should
%   have MAXNPEAK rows instead of NBIN rows. NPEAKFLAG = TRUE sets A, F,
%   and P to have size MAXNPEAK x NFRAME x NCHANNEL and NPEAKFLAG = FALSE
%   leaves the size of the input untouched. The default is NPEAKFLAG = FALSE
%   when MAXNUMPEAK is called with the syntax above. Note that A, F, and P
%   might still have NaN across columns that had fewer peaks than MAXNPEAK.
