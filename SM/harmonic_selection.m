%HARMONIC_SELECTION Selection of harmonic partials.
%   [Ah,Fh,Ph] = HARMONIC_SELECTION(A,F,P,NPART,NFRAME,NCHANNEL,F0,
%   MAX_HARM_DEV,HARM_THRESH,HARMPARTFLAG) returns the harmonic amplitudes
%   Ah, harmonic frequencies Fh, and harmonic phases Ph of the partial
%   track amplitudes A, frequencies F, and phases P. NPART is the number of
%   partials, NFRAME is the number of frames, NCHANNEL is the number of
%   channels, and F0 is the reference fundamental frequency.
%
%   [Ah,Fh,Ph] = HARMONIC_SELECTION(A,F,P,NPART,NFRAME,NCHANNEL,F0,
%   MAX_HARM_DEV) uses MAX_HARM_DEV as the maximum harmonic deviation in
%   cents to consider a frequency peak as harmonic. The default is
%   MAX_HARM_DEV = 100.
%
%   [Ah,Fh,Ph] = HARMONIC_SELECTION(A,F,P,NPART,NFRAME,NCHANNEL,F0,
%   MAX_HARM_DEV,HARM_THRESH) uses HARM_THRESH as the normalized harmonic
%   threshold. HARM_THRESH = 0 will select all partials regardless of
%   MAX_HARM_DEV. HARM_THRESH = 1 will only select partials that have 100%
%   of the frequency peaks within MAX_HARM_DEV. Ideally, HARM_THRESH should
%   allow for a small percentage of the frequency values to be outside of
%   MAX_HARM_DEV. The default is HARM_THRESH = 0.8.
%
%   [Ah,Fh,Ph] = HARMONIC_SELECTION(A,F,P,NPART,NFRAME,NCHANNEL,F0,
%   MAX_HARM_DEV,HARM_THRESH,HARMPARTFLAG) uses HARMPARTFLAG to select the
%   algorithm to resolve conflicts in harmonic selection. HARMPARTFLAG =
%   'COUNT' selects the partials with the highest relative number of
%   harmonic peaks across all frames and HARMPARTFLAG = 'MEAN' selects the
%   partials with the smallest average harmonic distance across all frames.
%
%   [Ah,Fh,Ph,MAXNHARM] = HARMONIC_SELECTION(_) also returns the highest
%   harmonic number MAXNHARM. Note that MAXNHARM is not necessarily the
%   number of active harmonics since there may be missing harmonics.
%
%   [Ah,Fh,Ph,MAXNHARM,INHARM] = HARMONIC_SELECTION(_) also returns the
%   inharmonic partials in the structure INHARM with fields INHARM.AMP for
%   the amplitudes, INHARM.FREQ for the frequencies, and INHARM.PH for the
%   phases. The fields may be empty if there are no inharmonic partials.
