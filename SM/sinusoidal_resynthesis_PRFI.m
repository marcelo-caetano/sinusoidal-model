%SINUSOIDAL_RESYNTHESIS_PRFI Sinusoidal resynthesis via phase
%reconstruction by frequency integration (PRFI) as described in [1].
%   [SIN,PART,At,Ft] = SINUSOIDAL_RESYNTHESIS_PRFI(A,F,Delta,M,H,Fs,NSAMPLE,
%   CFR,MAXNPEAK,CAUSALFLAG,DISPFLAG) synthesizes the sinusoidal model SIN
%   from the amplitude A and frequency F returned by
%   SINUSOIDAL_ANALYSIS. DELTA determines the frequency difference for peak
%   continuation as described in [1]. All other parameters come from the
%   frame-by-frame analysis step. Type HELP SINUSOIDAL_ANALYSIS for further
%   information on analysis and HELP SINUSOIDAL_RESYNTHESIS for synthesis.
%
%   Besides the sinusoidal model SIN, SINUSOIDAL_RESYNTHESIS_PRFI also
%   returns PART containing the individual partial that comprise SIN when
%   combined, At with the time-varying amplitude of PART and Ft with the
%   time-varying frequency.
